# TODO

- Fix failing workflows
    - Add overview of build statuses for all projects
- Harmonize
    - Show testthat output -> show test output
    - Decide on R 3.2
- Add code to prune branches in fork
- Add workflow to create commands
- Add code to sync/copy base to other branches
- BUG: Repositories cannot be named main, fix grep expressions searching for `main`

## Later

- Remove hard-coded github.com
- Use git-filter-repo

## Caveat

- Sync from remote repos overwrites history due to change in committer date. Can we cherry-pick with the original committer date? Do we need a low-level Git command?
    - Problem: commit from internal `.github/workflows`:

        ```text

    - Solved by double rebase with fallback to force-push

- Merges in local history can't be easily recreated in the remote repos

- Push to `templates/` then unrelated push doesn't trigger workflow?

## Done

- How to remove?
    - Remove branch, no foreign workflows
- Switch to scheduled sync back
    - Add local sync back action to every branch: doesn't work, scheduled works only for main branch
- Think about sync back on remote change
    - No
        - Implement merge back
            - With import, refresh=FALSE
            - Test with RKazam
        - How to resend secret to remote repository -- manual workflow run?
        - Trigger resend of secret when key is regenerated
